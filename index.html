          <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
            Link's Shield from the Legend of Zelda games is one of the most
            iconic symbols around. In the before time when we had comic book
            conventions I would make props and costumes. These are instruction
            on how I made one of my works.

        <h2>All About the Base</h2>
        <p>
          Print out pattern and tape it together. Cut out the base of the shield
          10mm. I cut it out in 2 parts. I did not have a piece of foam big
          enough to cut our a sold piece. The glue together each side.

        </p>
        <h2>Cut and Cover</h2>
        <p>
          Cut out another base piece. I used 6mm here. I wanted to use this
          piece to cover seam in the middle and to give the shield more
          stability. Glue cover on top of the. Line up the sides a best you can.
          Once they are glued together heat form both sides of the shield to
          give it a small curve.

              A 2mm cover will smooth out the center seam.

        </p>
        <h2>A Place to Hold on To</h2>
        <p>
          Add the border (10mm), the Crimson Loftwing (4mm), The Triforce
          (10mm), and the S patterned (10mm). Add a Handle to the back of the
          shield (10mm) and an extra strip that will go around your arm (4mm).

            <figcaption>
              Try to get the border as flush as you can. This will cut down on
              the amount of sanding.

        <h2>Hide Your Crimes</h2>
        <p>
          Clean up the edges of the shield with the Dremel tool and heat seal
          the foam with the heat gun. The foam should look shiny and close all
          the open pores of the foam. Fill in any open seams with Kwik seal.
          Smooth out with water and let dry over night.

            <figcaption>
              Kwick seal can be found in the plumbing section in any hardware
              store.

          </figure>
        </p>
        <h2>Seal It Up</h2>
        <p>
          To seal the foam I used 5 layers of Creature Cast for the front of the
          shield. Then 3 layers for the back. Clean off your brush after each
          layer and let each layer dry before adding the next one. Since this
          stuff is liquid rubber there will be times where parts will clump up.
          After the creator cast has dried over night the surface can be sanded
          down to get a smooth surface.

              This could also be done with 1 coat if in a hurry.

        <h2>Time for Paint</h2>
        <p >
          Paint the inside of the shield blue, the Loftwing red, the Triforce
          gold and the rest of the shield silver. Whether the Shield to look how
          beat up you want it to look.
