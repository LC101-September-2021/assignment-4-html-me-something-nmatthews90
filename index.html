        Link's Shield from the Legend of Zelda games is one of the most iconic
        symbols around. In the before time when we comic book conventions I
        would make props and costumes. These are instruction on how I made one
        of my works.

      <h2>All About the Base</h2>
      <p>
        Print out pattern and tape it together. Cut out the base of the shield
        10mm. I cut it out in 2 parts. I did not have a piece of foam big enough
        to cut our a sold piece. The glue together each side.
      </p>
      <h2>Cut and Cover</h2>
      <p>
        Cut out another base piece. I used 6mm here. I wanted to use this piece
        to cover seam in the middle and to give the shield more stability. Glue
        cover on top of the. Line up the sides a best you can. Once they are
        glued together heat form both sides of the shield to give it a small
        curve.
      </p>
      <h2>A Place to Hold on To</h2>
      <p>
        Add the border (10mm), the Crimson Loftwing (4mm), The Triforce (10mm),
        and the S patterned (10mm). Add a Handle to the back of the shield
        (10mm) and an extra strip that will go around your arm (4mm).
      </p>
      <h2>Hide Your Crimes</h2>
      <p>
        Clean up the edges of the shield with the Dremel tool and heat seal the
        foam with the heat gun. The foam should look shiny and close all the
        open pores of the foam. Fill in any open seams with Kwik seal. Smooth
        out with water and let dry over night.
      </p>
      <h2>Seal It Up</h2>
      <p>
        To seal the foam I used 5 layers of Creature Cast for the front of the
        shield. Then 3 layers for the back. Clean off your brush after each
        layer and let each layer dry before adding the next one. Since this
        stuff is liquid rubber there will be times where parts will clump up.
        After the creator cast has dried over night the surface can be sanded
        down to get a smooth surface.
      </p>
      <h2>Time for Paint</h2>
      <p>
        Paint the inside of the shield blue, the Loftwing red, the Triforce gold
        and the rest of the shield silver. Whether the Shield to look how beat
        up you want it to look.
